# CHIP8 emulator done in Rust

or more like an interpreter..

Right now most games meant for chip8 work (sound not supported). Some opcodes are ambigious and not everything is guaranteed to work.

#TODO
Add sound support
Finetune opcodes so that different implementations are supported
Add SUPER-CHIP support
Add debug capabilities
Add XO-CHIP support
